# Based on a mix between Kirby and Webslides

Kirby is a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.
Please buy a license at <http://getkirby.com/buy>

> The idea : make nice presentation online with a little back-office

# Todo 

- Make a helper for image selection (Unsplah code, uploaded or default) o be added to default and cover slides 
- Plut√¥t avoir un dropdown pour choisir le genre de template qu'on veut
